<h2><i>GOOD FISHING!</i></h2>


<p><i>This little writing has to do with the streams and the trout therein of that portion of our country extending
southward from the southern boundary of Montana to the Teton mountains, and eastward from the eastern
boundary of Idaho to the Absaroka range. Lying on both sides of the continental divide, its surface is veined
by the courses of a multitude of streams flowing either to the Pacific Ocean or to the Gulf of Mexico, while
from the southern rim of this realm of wonders the waters reach the Gulf of California through the mighty
canyons carved by the Colorado.</i></p>

<p><i>This region has abundant attractions for seekers of outdoor pleasures, and for none more than for the
angler. Here, within a space about seventy miles square, nature has placed a bewildering diversity of
rivers, mountains, lakes, canyons, geysers and waterfalls not found elsewhere in the world. Fortunately,
Congress early reserved the greater part of this domain as a public pleasure ground. Under the wise administration
of government officials the natural beauties are protected and made accessible by superb roads. The
streams also, many of which were barren of fish, have, by successful plantings and intelligent protection, become
all that the sportsman can wish. The angler who wanders through the woods in almost any direction will
scarcely fail to find some picturesque lake or swift flowing stream where the best of sport may be had with the
rod.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Several years ago I made my first visit to this country, and it has been my privilege to return thither
annually on fishing excursions of varying duration. These outings have been so enjoyable and have yielded
so much pleasure at the time and afterwards, that I should like to sound the angler's pack-cry, "Good Fishing!"
loudly enough to lead others to go also.</i></p>

<p><i>The photographs from which the illustrations were made, except where due credit is given to others,
were taken with a small hand camera which has hung at my belt in crossing mountains and wading streams,
and are mainly of such scenes as one comes upon in out-of-the-way places while following that "most
virtuous pastime" of fly-casting.</i></p>

</div>

<div class="unindent"><br />EFORE exercising the right of eminent domain over these
waters, it may be profitable to say a word in explanation of
the fact that hardly more than a score of years ago many
of these beautiful lakes and streams were absolutely without
fish life. This will aid us in understanding what the
government has done and is still doing to create an ideal
paradise for the angler among these mountains and plateaus.</div>

<p>There was a time, and this too in comparatively recent
geological eras, when the waters of that region now under
consideration abounded with fish of many species. The clumsy
catfish floundered along the shallows and reedy bayous in company
with the solemn red-horse and a long line of other fishes of present and
past generations. The lordly salmon found ideal spawning grounds
in the gravelly beds of the streams draining to the westward, and
doubtless came hither annually in great numbers. It may be that
the habit of the Columbia river salmon to return yearly from the
Pacific and ascend that stream was bred into the species during the
days when its waters ran in an uninterrupted channel from source
to sea. It is true that elsewhere salmon manifest this anadromous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
impulse in as marked a degree as in the Columbia and its tributaries, yet, the conclusion that these
heroic pilgrimages are <i>habit</i> resulting from similar movements, accidental at first, but extending over
countless years, is natural, and probably correct. When one sees these noble fish congested by thousands
at the foot of some waterfall up which not one in a hundred is able to leap, or observes them
ascending the brooks in the distant mountains where there is not sufficient water to cover them,
gasping, bleeding, dying, but pushing upward with their last breath, the figure of the crusaders in
quest of an ancient patrimony arises in the mind, so strong is the simile and so active is your sympathy
with the fish.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i-06.jpg" width="400" height="304" alt="Mammoth Hot Springs" title="" />
<span class="caption">Mammoth Hot Springs</span>
</div>

<p>In those distant days the altitude of this region was not great, nor was the ocean as remote from
its borders as now. The forces which already had lifted considerable
areas above the sea and fashioned them into an embryo continent
were still at work. The earth-shell, yet soft and
plastic, was not strong enough to resist the double strain
caused by its cooling, shrinking outer crust and the
expanding, molten interior. Volcanic eruptions, magnificent
in extent, resulted and continued at intervals
throughout the Pliocene period. These eruptions were
accompanied by prodigious outpours of lava that
altered the topography of the entire mountain section.
Nowhere else in all creation has such an amount of
matter been forced up from the interior of the earth to
flow in red-hot rivers to the distant seas as in the western
part of the United States. What a panorama of flame it
was, and what a sublime impression it must have made on
the minds of the primeval men who witnessed it from afar as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
they paddled their canoes over the troubled waters
that reflected the red-litten heavens beneath them!
Is it remarkable that the geyser region of the Park
is a place of evil repute among the savages and a
thing to be passed by on the other side, even to
the present day?</p>

<span class="caption">Detail from Jupiter Terrace</span>
</div>

<p>When the elemental forces subsided the waters
were fishless, and all aquatic life had been destroyed
in the creation of the glories of the Park
and its surroundings. Streams that once had their
origins in sluggish, lily-laden lagoons, now took
their sources from the lofty continental plateaus.
In reaching the lower levels these streams, in
most instances, fell over cataracts so high as to be
impassable to fish, thus precluding their being restocked
by natural processes. From this cause the
upper Gardiner, the Gibbon and the Firehole rivers
and their tributaries&mdash;streams oftenest seen by the tourist&mdash;were found to contain no trout when man
entered upon the scene. From a sportsman's viewpoint the troutless condition of the very choicest
waters was fortunate, as it left them free for the planting of such varieties as are best adapted to the
food and character of each stream.</p>

<p>The blob or miller's thumb existed in the Gibbon river, and perhaps in other streams, above the
falls. Its presence in such places is due to its ability to ascend very precipitous water courses by means
of the filamentous algae which usually border such torrents. I once discovered specimens of this odd
fish in the algous growth covering the rocky face of the falls of the Des Chutes river, at Tumwater, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
state of Washington, and there is little doubt that they
do ascend nearly vertical walls where the conditions are
favorable.</p>

<span class="caption">Tumwater Falls</span>
</div>

<p>The presence of the red-throat trout of the Snake
river in the head waters of the Missouri is easily explained
by the imperfect character of the water-shed between the
Snake and Yellowstone rivers. Atlantic Creek, tributary
to the Yellowstone, and Pacific Creek, tributary to the
Snake, both rise in the same marshy meadow on the
continental divide. From this it is argued that, during
the sudden melting of heavy snows in early times, it was
possible for specimens to cross from one side to the other,
and it is claimed that an interchange of individuals might
occur by this route at the present day.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> Certain it is that
these courageous fish exhibit the same disregard for their
lives that is spoken of previously as characteristic of their
congeners, the salmon. Trout are frequently found lying
dead on the grass of a pasture or meadow where they
were stranded the night previous in an attempt to explore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
a rivulet caused by a passing shower. The mortality among fish of this species in irrigated districts is
alarming. At each opening of the sluice gates they go out with the current and perish in the fields.
Unless there is a more rigid enforcement of the law requiring that the opening into the ditches be
screened, trout must soon disappear from the irrigated sections.</p>

<p>The supposition that these fish have crossed the continental divide, as it were, overland, serves the
double purpose of explaining the presence of the trout, and the absence of the chub, sucker and white-fish
of the Snake River from Yellowstone Lake. The latter are feeble fish at best, and generally display
a preference for the quiet waters of the deeper pools where they feed near the bottom and with little
exertion. Neither the chub, sucker nor white-fish possesses enough hardihood to undertake so precarious
a journey nor sufficient vitality to survive it.</p>

came into the Missouri basin by way of Two-Ocean Pass from the Upper

The trout of the two sides of the pass cannot be separated, and constitute

<div class='unindent'><br /><br /><br />O MANY people a trout is merely a <i>trout</i>, with no distinction
as to variety or origin; and some there be who know him
only as a <i>fish</i>, to be eaten without grace and with much
gossip. Again, there are those who have written at great
length of this and that species and sub-species, with many
words and nice distinctions relative to vomerine teeth, branchiostegal
rays and other anatomical differences. I would not lead
you, even if your patience permitted, along the tedious path of
the scientist, but will follow the middle path and note only such
differences in the members of this interesting family as may be
apparent to the unpracticed eye and by which the novice may
distinguish between the varieties that come to his creel.</div>

<p>In a letter to Doctor David Starr Jordan, in September,
1889, Hon. Marshall McDonald, then U. S. Commissioner of
Fish and Fisheries, wrote, "I have proposed to undertake
to stock these waters with different species of Salmonidae,
reserving a distinct river basin for each." Every one
will commend the wisdom of the original intent as it existed
in the mind of Mr. McDonald. It implied that a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
careful study would be made of the waters of each basin to
determine the volume and character of the current, its temperature,
the depth to which it froze during the sub-arctic winters,
and the kinds and quantities of fish-food found in each. With
this data well established, and knowing, as fish culturists have
for centuries, what conditions are favorable to the most desirable
kinds of trout, there was a field for experimentation and
improvement probably not existing elsewhere.</p>

<p>The commission began its labors in 1889, and the record for
that year shows among other plants, the placing of a
quantity of Loch Leven trout in the Firehole above the
Kepler Cascade. The year following nearly ten thousand
German trout fry were planted in Nez Perce Creek, the principal tributary of the Firehole. Either
the agents of the commission authorized to make these plants
were ignorant of the purpose of the Commissioner at Washington,
or they did not know with what immunity fish will
pass over the highest falls. Whatever the reason for this
error, the die is cast, and the only streams that have a single
distinct variety are the upper Gardiner and its tributaries,
where the eastern brook trout has the field, or rather the
waters, to himself. The first attempt to stock any stream
was a transfer of the native trout of another stream to Lava
Creek above the falls. I mention this because the presence
of the native trout in this locality has led some to believe
that they were there from the first, and thus constituted an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
exception to the rule that no trout
were found in streams above vertical
waterfalls.</p>

<p>Many are confused by the variety
of names applied to the native trout
of the Yellowstone, <i>Salmo lewisi</i>.
Red-throat trout, cut-throat trout,
black-spotted trout, mountain trout,
Rocky Mountain trout, salmon trout,
and a host of other less generally
known local names have been applied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
to him. This is in a measure due to the widely different localities and conditions under which he is found,
and to the very close resemblance he bears to his first cousins, <i>Salmo clarkii</i>, of the streams flowing into the
Pacific from northern California to southern Alaska; and to <i>Salmo mykiss</i> of the Kamchatkan rivers.
Perhaps the very abundance of this trout has cheapened the estimate in which he is held by some
anglers. Nevertheless, he is a royal fish. In streams with rapid currents he is always a hard fighter, and
his meat is high-colored and well-flavored.</p>

<p>The name "black-spotted" trout describes this fish more accurately than any other of his cognomens.
The spots are carbon-black and have none of the vermilion and purple colors that characterize
the brook trout. The spots are not, however, always uniform in size and number. In some instances
they are entirely wanting on the anterior part of the body, but their absence is not sufficiently important
to constitute a varietal distinction. The red dash under the throat (inner edge of the mandible)
from which the names "cut-throat" and "red-throat" are derived, is never absent in specimens taken
here, and, as no other trout of this locality is so marked, it affords the tyro an unfailing means of
determining the nature of his catch.</p>

<p>If the eastern brook trout, <i>Salvelinus fontinalis</i>, could read and
understand but a part of the praises that have been sung of him in
prose and verse through all the years, what a pampered princeling
and nuisance he would become! But to his credit, he has gone on
being the same sensible, shrewd, wary and delightful fish, adapting
himself to all sorts of mountain streams, lakes, ponds and rivers, and
always giving the largest returns to the angler in the way of health
and happiness. The literature concerning the methods employed
in his capture alone would make a library in which we should find
the names of soldiers, statesmen and sovereigns, and the great of
the earth. Aelian, who lived in the second century A. D., describes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
in his <i>De Animalium Natura</i>, how the Macedonians
took a fish with speckled skin from
a certain river by means of a hook tied
about with red wool, to which were fitted
two feathers from a cock's wattle. More
than four hundred years prior to this
Theocritus mentioned a method of fishing
with a "fallacious bait suspended from a
rod," but unfortunately failed to tell us how
the fly was made. If by any chance you
have never met the brook trout you may
know him infallibly from his brethren by
the dark olive, worm-like lines, technically
called "vermiculations," along the back, as
he alone displays these heraldic markings.</p>

<p>Throughout the northwest the brown
trout, <i>Salmo fario</i>, is generally known as the "von Behr"
trout, from the name of the German fish-culturist who sent the first shipment of their eggs to this country.
This fish may be distinguished at sight by the coarse scales which give his body a dark grayish
appearance, slightly resembling a mullet, and by the large dull red spots along the lateral line. There
are also three beautiful red spots on the adipose fin.</p>

<p>The Loch Leven trout, <i>Salmo levenensis</i>, comes from a lake of that name in southern Scotland.
He is a canny, uncertain fellow, and nothing like as hardy as we might expect from his origin. In the
Park waters he has not justified the fame for gameness which he brings from abroad, but there are
occasions, particularly in the vicinity of the Lone Star geyser, when he comes on with a very pretty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
rush. In general appearance he somewhat resembles
the von Behr trout, but is a more graceful and finely
organized fish than the latter. He is the only trout
of this locality that has no red on his body, and its
absence is sufficient to distinguish him from all others.</p>

<p>No one can possibly mistake the rainbow trout,
<i>Salmo irideus</i>, for any other species. The large,
brilliant spots with which his silvery-bluish body is
covered, and that filmy iridescence so admired
by every one, will identify him anywhere. There
is, however, a marked difference in the brilliance
of this iridescence between fish of different ages
as well as between stream-raised and hatchery-bred
specimens, and even among fish from the
upper and lower courses of the same stream.</p>

<p>The question as to which is the more beautiful, the rainbow
or the brook trout, has often been debated with much feeling by
their respective champions, and will doubtless remain undecided
so long as both may be taken from clear-flowing brooks, where
sky and landscape blend with the soul of man to make him as
supremely happy as it is ever the lot of mortals to become. For
it is the joy within and around you that supplies a mingled
pleasure far deeper than that afforded by the mere beauty of the
fish. You will remember that "Doctor Boteler" said of the
strawberry, "Doubtless God could have made a better berry, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
doubtless God never did." So, I have said at different times of <i>both</i> brook
and rainbow trout, "Doubtless God could have made a more beautiful fish
than this, but doubtless God never did."</p>

<p>During a recent trip through the Rocky Mountains I remained over night
in a town of considerable mining importance. In the evening I walked up
the main street passing an almost unbroken line of saloons, gambling
houses and dance halls, then crossed the street to return, and found
the same conditions on that side, except that, if possible, the crowds
were noisier. Just before reaching the hotel, I came upon a small
restaurant in the window of which was an aquarium containing a number
of rainbow trout. One beautiful fish rested quivering, pulsating, resplendent, poised apparently
in mid air, while the rays from an electric light within were so refracted
that they formed an aureola about the fish, seemingly transfiguring it. I
paused long in meditation on the scene, till aroused from my revery by
the blare of a graphophone from a resort across the street. It sang:</p>

<div class='unindent'><br /><br /><br />ANY who know these mountains and valleys best
have gained their knowledge with a rod in hand,
and you will hear these individuals often express
surprise that a greater number of tourists do not
avail themselves of the splendid opportunities
offered for fishing. In no other way can so much
pleasure be found on the trip, and by no other means
can you put yourself so immediately and completely
in sympathy with the spirit of the wilderness. Besides,
it is this doing something more than being a
mere passenger that gives the real interest and zest to
existence and that yields the best returns in the
memories of delightful days. The ladies may be
taken along without the least inconvenience and
to the greater enjoyment of the outing. What
if the good dame has never seen an artificial fly!
Take her anyway, if she will go, and we will make her acquainted with streams where she shall have
moderate success if she but stand in the shadow of the willows and tickle the surface of the pool with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
single fly. You will feel mutually grateful, each for the presence of the other; and, depend upon it,
it will make the recollection doubly enjoyable.</div>

<p>We shall never know and name all the hot springs and geysers of this wonderland, but we may become
acquainted with the voice of a stream and know it as the speech of a friend. We may establish
fairly intimate relations with the creatures of the wood and be admitted to some sort of brotherhood with
them if we conduct ourselves becomingly. The timid grouse will acknowledge the caress of our bamboo
with an arching of the neck, and the beaver will bring for our inspection his freight of willow or alder,
and will at times swim confidently between our legs when we are wading in deep water.</p>

<p>The author of "Little Rivers" draws this pleasing picture of the delights of fishing: "You never get
so close to the birds as when you are wading quietly down a little river, casting your fly deftly under the
branches for the wary trout, but ever on the lookout for all the pleasant things that nature has to bestow
upon you. Here you shall come upon the catbird at her morning bath, and hear her sing, in a clump
of pussy-willows, that low, tender, confidential song which she keeps for the hours of domestic intimacy.
The spotted sand-piper will run along the stones before you,
crying, 'wet-feet, wet-feet!' and bowing and teetering in the
friendliest manner, as if to show you the best pools."
Surely, if this invitation move you not, no voice of
mine will serve to stir your laggard legs.</p>

<p>One should not, however, go to the wilderness
and expect it to receive him at once with open arms.
It was there before him and will remain long after
he is forgotten. But approach it humbly and its
asperities will soften and in time become akin to affection.
As one looks for the first time through the black,
basaltic archway at the entrance to the Park, the nearby<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
mountains have an air of distance and unfriendliness, nor do
they speedily assume a more sympathetic relation toward the
visitor. A region in which the world's formative forces linger
ten thousand years after they have disappeared elsewhere will
make no hasty alliance with strangers. The heavy foot of time
treads so slowly here that one must come often and with observant
eye to note the advance from season to season and to
feel that he has any part or interest in it.</p>

<p>When we can judge correctly from the height of the up-springing
vegetation whether the forest fire that blackened
this hillside raged one year ago or ten; when we have noted
that the bowl of this terrace, increasing in height by the
insensible deposit of carbonate of lime from the overflowing
waters, appears to outstrip from year to year the growth of the
neighboring cedars; when these and a multitude of kindred phenomena are comprehended, how interested
we become!</p>

<p>Nothing said here is intended to encourage undue familiarity with the wild game. "Shinny on your
own side," is a good motto with any game, and more than one can testify of sudden and unexpected
trouble brought on themselves by meddlesomeness. In following an elk trail through the woods one
afternoon, I found a pine tree had fallen across the path making a barrier about hip-high. While
looking about to see whether any elk had gone over the trail since the tree fell, and, if so, whether
they had leaped the barrier or had passed around it by way of the root or top, a squirrel with a pine
cone in his teeth, sprang on the butt of the tree and came jauntily along the log. Some twenty feet away
he spied me, and suddenly his whole manner and bearing changed. He dropped the cone and came on
with a bow-legged, swaggering air, the very embodiment of insolent proprietorship. The top of my rod<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
extended over the log, and as he came under it I gave him a
smart switch across the back. Now, there had been nothing
in my previous acquaintance with squirrels to lead me
to think them other than most timid animals. But the
slight blow of the rod-tip transformed this one into a Fury.
With a peculiar half-bark, half-scream, he leaped at my face
and slashed at my neck and ears with his powerful jaws.
So strong was he that I could not drag him loose when his
teeth were buried in my coat collar. I finally choked him
till he loosened his hold and flung him ten feet away. Back
he came to the attack with the speed of a wild cat. It was
either retreat for me or death to the squirrel, and I retreated.
Never before had I witnessed such an exhibition
of diabolical malevolence, and, though I have laughed over
it since, I was too much upset for an hour afterward to
see the funny side of the encounter.</p>

<p>The ways of the wilderness have ever been pleasant
to my feet, and whether it was taking the ouananiche
in Canada or the Beardslee trout in the shadow of the
Olympics, it has all been good. Without detracting from
the sport afforded by any other locality, I honestly believe
that, taking into consideration climate, comfort, scenery,
environment, and the opportunities for observing wild life, this region has no equal for trout fishing
under the sun. I am aware that he who praises the fishing on any stream will ever have two classes
of critics&mdash;the unthinking and the unsuccessful. To these I would say, "Whether your success shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
be greater or less than mine will depend upon the conditions of weather and stream and on your own
skill, and none of these do I control." In that splendid book, "Fly-Rods and Fly-Tackle," Mr. Henry
P. Wells relates an instance in which he and his guide took an angler to a distant lake with the certain
promise and expectation of fine fishing. After recording the keen disappointment he felt that not a
single trout would show itself, he says, "Then I vowed a vow, which I commend to the careful consideration
of all anglers, old and new alike&mdash;never again, under any circumstances, will I recommend any fishing
locality in terms substantially stronger than these 'At that place I have done so and so; under like
conditions it is believed that you can repeat it.' We are apt to speak of a place and the sport it affords
as we found it, whereas reflection and
experience should teach us that it is
seldom exactly the same, even for two
successive days."</p>

<p>There is a large number of fly-fishermen
in the east who sincerely
believe that the best sport cannot be
had in the streams of the Rocky
Mountains, and this belief has a grain
of truth when the fishing is confined
solely to native trout and to streams
of indifferent interest. But when the
waters flow through such picturesque
surroundings as are found in the
Yellowstone National Park, when
from among these waters one may
select the stream that shall furnish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the trout he loves most to take, the objection is most fully answered. The writer can attest how difficult
it was to outgrow the conviction that a certain brook of the Alleghanies had no equal, but he now gladly
concedes that there are streams in the west just as prolific of fish and as pleasant to look upon as the
one he followed in boyhood. It is proper enough to maintain that: "The fields are greenest where our
childish feet have strayed," but when we permit a mere sentiment to prevent the fullest enjoyment of
the later opportunities of life, your beautiful sentiment becomes a harmful prejudice.</p>

<p>When the prophet required Naaman to go down and bathe in the river Jordan, Naaman was exceeding
wroth, and exclaimed, "Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than any in Israel?"
The record hath it that Naaman went and bathed in the
Jordan, and that his <i>body</i> was healed of its <i>leprosy</i> and
his <i>mind</i> of its <i>conceit</i>. So, when my angling friend
from New Brunswick inquires whether I have
fished the Waskahegan or have tried the lower
pools of the Assametaquaghan for salmon, I am
compelled to answer <i>no</i>. But there comes a
longing to give him a day's outing on Hell-Roaring
Creek or to see him a-foul of a five-pound
von Behr trout amid the steam of the
Riverside Geyser. The streams of Maine and
Canada are delightful and possess a charm that
lingers in the mind like the minor chords of
almost forgotten music, but they cannot be
compared with the full-throated torrents of
the Absarokas. As well liken a fugue with
flute and cymbals to an oratorio with
bombardon and sky-rockets!</p>

<div class="unindent"><br /><br /><br />IVE centuries have passed since the dignified
and devout prioress of St. Albans indited the
above sentence, and the tribute to the sterling
good sense therein is that the growing years
have but added to its authority. A dozen well
selected varieties of flies, dubbe them how ye
lyke, are well-nigh sufficient for any locality.
There may be streams that require a wider range
of choice, but these are so rare that they may
safely be considered as exceptional. Not that
any particular harm has resulted from the unreasonable
increase in the number and varieties
of artificial flies. They amuse and gratify the
tyro and in no wise disturb the master of the
art. But an over-plethoric fly book in the
possession of a stranger will, with the knowing,
place the angling ability of the owner under suspicion. Better a thousand-fold, are the single half-dozen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
flies the uses and seasons of which are fully understood than a multitude of meaningless creations.</div>

<p>The angler should strive to attain an intelligent understanding of the principal features of the artificial
fly and how a change in the form and color of these features affects the behavior of the fish for which he
angles. In studying this matter men have gone down in diving suits that they might better see the fly
as it appeared when presented to the fish, and there is nothing in their reports to encourage extremely
fine niceties in fly-dressing. One may know a great deal of artists and their work and yet truly know
but little of the value of <i>art</i> itself; or have been a great reader of economics, and yet have little practical
knowledge of that complex product of society called <i>civilization</i>. So, I had rather possess the knowledge
a dear friend of mine has of Dickens, Shakespeare, and the Bible alone than to be able to discuss
"literature" in general before clubs and societies.</p>

<p>Several years of angling experience in the far west have convinced the writer that flies of full bodies
and positive colors are the most killing, and that the palmers are slightly better than the hackles. Of
the standard patterns of flies the most successful are the coachman, royal coachman, black hackle,
Parmacheene Belle, with the silver doctor for lake fishing, in the order named. The trout here, with
the exception of those in Lake Yellowstone, are fairly vigorous fighters, and it is important that your
tackle should be strong and sure rather than elegant.</p>

</div>
<p>With a view of determining whether it were possible to make a fly that would answer nearly all
the needs of the mountain fisherman, I began, in 1897, a series of experiments in fly-tying that continued
over a period of five years. The result is the production of what is widely known in the west as
the Pitcher fly. As before indicated, this fly did not spring full panoplied into being, but was evolved from
standard types by gradual modifications. The body is a furnace hackle, tied palmer; tail of barred
wood-duck feather; wing snow-white, to which is added a blue cheek. The name, "Pitcher," was given
to it as a compliment to Major John Pitcher, who, as acting superintendent of the Yellowstone National
Park, has done much to improve the quality of the fishing in these streams.</p>

<p>From a dozen states anglers have written testifying to the killing qualities of the Pitcher Fly, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the extracts following show that its
success is not confined to any locality
nor to any single species of trout:</p>

<p>"The Pitcher flies you gave me have
aided me in filling my twenty-pound
basket three times in the last three
weeks. Have had the best sport this
season I have ever enjoyed on the
Coeur d'Alene waters, and I can truthfully
say I owe it all to the
Pitcher fly and its designer."</p>

<p>"One afternoon I had put up my rod and strolled down
to the river where one of our party was whipping a pool
of the Big Hole, trying to induce a fish to strike. He said:
'There's an old villain in there; he wants to strike but can't
make up his mind to do it.' I said: 'I have a fly that will
make him strike,' and as I had my book in my pocket I
handed him a No. 8 Pitcher. He made two casts and
hooked a beautiful trout, that weighed nineteen ounces,
down. I regard the Pitcher as the best killer in my book."</p>

<p>"I determined to follow the stream up into the mountains,
but as I neared the woods at the upper end of the
meadow I stopped to cast into a long, straight reach of the
river where the breeze from the ocean was rippling the surface
of the stream. The grassy bank rose steep behind me
and only a little fringe of wild roses partly concealed me
from the water. I cast the Pitcher flies you gave me well
out on the rough water, allowed them to sink a hand-breadth,
and at the first movement of the line I saw that heart-expanding
flash of a broad silver side gleaming from the
clear depths. The trout fastened on savagely, and as he
was coming my way, I assisted his momentum with all
the spring of the rod, and he came flying out into the
clean, fresh grass of the meadow behind me. It was a half-pound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
speckled brook trout. I did not stop
to pouch him, but cast again. In a moment
I was fast to another such, and again I
sprung him bodily out, glistening like a
silver ingot, to where his brother lay. In
my first twelve casts I took ten such fish,
all from ten to twelve inches long, mostly
without any playing. I took twenty-two
fine fish without missing one strike, and
landed every one safely. I was not an
hour in taking the lot. Then oddly enough,
I whipped the water for fifty yards without
another rise. Satisfied that the circus was over, I climbed up
into the meadow and gathered the spoils into my basket.
Nearly all were brook trout, but two or three silvery salmon trout
among them had struck quite as gamely. I had such a weight
of fish as I never took before on the Nekanicum in our most
fortunate fishing."</p>

<p>"Walking back along the trail, I came again to the long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
reach where I had my luck an hour before,
and cast again to see if there might be
another fish. Two silver glints shone up
through the waves in the same instant.
I struck one of the two fish, though I
might have had both if I had left the
flies unmoved the fraction of a second.
Three times I refused such doublets, for
I had not changed an inch of tackle, and
scarcely even looked the casting line over.
It was no time to allow two good fish to
go raking that populous pool. However
I did take chances with one doublet.
So out of the same lucky spot on my
return, I took ten more fish each about a
foot long. I brought nearly every one
flying out as I struck him, and I never
put such a merciless strain on a rod before.</p>

<p>"I had concluded again that the new tenantry had all been
evicted, and was casting 'most extended' trying the powers
of the rod and reaching, I should say, sixty feet out. As the
flies came half-way in and I was just about snatching them out
for a long back cast, the father of the family soared after them
in a gleaming arc. He missed by not three inches and bored his
way straight down into the depths of the clear green water. 'My heart went out to him,' as our friend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Wells said, but coaxing was in vain. I tried them above and below, sinking the flies deeply, or
dropping them airily upon the waves, but to no purpose. I had the comforting thought that we may
pick him up when you are here this summer."</p>

<div class='unindent'><br /><br /><br />RIZZLY LAKE lies secluded among the
timbered hills, four miles south&mdash;south and
west&mdash;from Willow Park. The long narrow
bed of the lake was furrowed by a
glacier that once debouched here from
the mountains to the west, and through
the gravel and detritus that surround it
the melting snows and rain are filtered
till the water is fit for the Olympian
deities. No more profitable place can be
found for the angler to visit. The lake swarms
with brook trout weighing from one to
five pounds, and in the ice-cold water
which is supplied with an abundance of
insect and crustacean food the fish are in
prime condition after July first. The best
fishing is at the southern end, near where Straight Creek enters the lake. A little investigation will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
discover close at hand, several large springs that
flow into the lake at this point, and here the trout
congregate after the spawning season.</div>

<p>In order to reach this location conveniently, I,
early in 1902, constructed a light raft of dry pine
logs, about six by ten feet, well spiked together
with drift bolts; since which time other parties
have added a substantial row boat. Both the boat
and the raft may be found at the lower end of the
lake, just where the trail brings you to it. The
canvas boat that was set up on the lake earlier,
was destroyed the first winter by bears, but the
boat and raft now there will probably hold their
own against the beasts of the field for some time.
If you use either of them you will, of course, return
it to the outlet of the lake, that he who cometh
after may also enjoy.</p>

<p>The route to Grizzly Lake follows very closely the Bannock
Indian trail from the point where Straight Creek enters the meadows of Willow Park to the outlet of
the lake. The trail itself is interesting. It was the great Indian thoroughfare between Idaho and the
Big Horn Basin in Wyoming, and was doubtless an ancient one at the time the Romans dominated
Britain. How plainly the record tells you that it was made by an aboriginal people. Up hill and
down hill, across marsh or meadow, it is always a single trail, trodden into furrow-like distinctness
by moccasined feet. Nowhere does it permit the going abreast of the beasts of draft or burden. At
no place does it suggest the side-by-side travel of the white man for companionship's sake, nor the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
hand-in-hand converse of mother and
child, lover and maid. Ease your
pony a moment here and dream.
Here comes the silent procession on
its way to barter in the land of the
stranger, and here again it will return
in the autumn, as it has done for a
thousand years. In the van are the
blanketed braves, brimful of in-toeing,
painful dignity. Behind these
follow the ponies drawing the lodge-poles
and camp outfit, and then come
the squaws and the children. Just
there is a bend in the trail and the
lodge-poles have abraded the tree in
the angle till it is worn half through.
A little further on, in an open glade,
they camped for the night. Decades
have come and gone since the last
Indian party passed this way, yet a cycle hence the trail will be distinct at intervals.</p>

<p>By turning to the west at Winter Creek and passing over the sharp hills that border that stream
you will come, at the end of a nine-mile journey, to Lake Rose. The way is upward through groves of
pane, thickets of aspen, and steep open glades surrounded by silver fir trees that would be the delight
of a landscape gardener if he could cause them to grow in our city parks as they do here. Elk
are everywhere. We ride through and around bands of them, male, female, and odd-shapen calves with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
wobbly legs and luminous, questioning
eyes. As you pause now and then to
contemplate some new view of the
wilderness unfolding before you, the
beauty, and freedom and serenity of
it are irresistible, and you comprehend
for the first time the spirit of
the Argonauts of '49 and the nobility
of the p&aelig;an they chanted to express
their exalted brotherhood:</p>

<p>Suddenly the ground slopes away before us and Lake Rose lies at our feet, like an amethyst in a chalice
of jade-green onyx. The surroundings are picturesque. The mountains descend abruptly to the water's
edge and the snow never quite disappears from its banks in the longest summer. Here in June may
be seen that incredible thing, the wild strawberry blossoming bravely above the slush-snow that still
hides the plant below, and the bitter-root putting forth buds in the lee of a snow
bank. A small stream enters the lake at the northwest, and here the trout are
most abundant. They rise eagerly to the silver doctor fly, a half dozen often
breaking at once, any one of which is a weight for a rod. Probably not
more than a score of anglers have ever cast a fly from this point, and a word
of caution may for this reason be pardoned. The low temperature of
the water retards the spawning season till midsummer, consequently trout
should not be taken here earlier than the third week of July. Again,
nature has given to every true sportsman the good sense to stop
when he has enough, and as this unwritten law is practically his only
restraint, he should feel that its observance is in safe hands and that
the sportsman's limit will be strictly observed.</p>

<div class='unindent'><br /><br /><br />HEN the snows have disappeared from the
valleys and lower hills, and the streams have
fallen to the level of their banks and their
waters have lost the brown stain filtered from
decaying leaves, and have resumed the chatty,
confidential tones of summer, then is the time
to angle for the brown trout. If you would
know the exact hour, listen for the brigadier
bird as he sings morning and evening from a
tall tree at the mouth of Iron Creek. When
you hear his lonely wood-note, joint your
rod and take the path through the lodge-pole
pines that brings you to the creek about
three hundred yards above its confluence
with the river. The lush grass of the meadow
is ankle-deep with back water from the main
stream, and Iron Creek and the Little Firehole lie level-lipped and currentless. As you look quietly on
from the shade of a tree, the water breaks into circles in a dozen places, and just at the edge of a bank
where the sod overhangs the stream there is a mighty splash which is repeated several times. Move<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
softly, for the ground is spongy and
vibrates under a heavy tread sufficiently
to warn the fish for many yards,
then the stream becomes suddenly silent
and you will wait long for the trout to resume
their feeding.</div>

<p>Stealthily drop the fly just over the
edge of the bank, as though some witless
insect had lost his hold above and
fallen!&mdash;Right Honorable Dean of the
Guild, I read the other day an article
in which you stated that the brown
trout never leaps on a slack line.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Surely you are right, and this is not a trout after
all, but a flying fish, for he went down stream in
three mighty and unexpected leaps that wrecked
your theory and the top joint of the rod before
the line could be retrieved. Then the fly comes
limply home and nothing remains of the sproat
hook but the shank.</p>

<p>These things happened to a friend in less
time than is taken in the telling. When he
had recovered from the shock he remarked,
smilingly, "That wasn't half bad for a Dutchman,
now, was it?" As he is a sensible fellow
and has no "tendency toward effeminate
attenuation" in tackle, he graciously accepted
and used the proffered cast of Pitcher flies
tied on number six O'Shaughnessy hooks.</p>

<p>Having ventured this much concerning what the writer considers <i>proper</i> tackle, he would like to go
further and record here his disapproval of the individual who turns up his nose at any rod of over five
ounces in weight, and who tells you with an air from which you are expected to infer much, that fly fishing
is really the only <i>honorable</i> and <i>gentlemanly</i> manner of taking trout. In the language of one who was a
master of concise and forceful phrase, "This is one of the deplorable fishing affectations and pretences
which the rank and file of the fraternity ought openly to expose and repudiate. Our irritation is greatly
increased when we recall the fact that every one of these super-refined fly-casting dictators, when he fails
to allure trout by his most scientific casts, will chase grasshoppers to the point of profuse perspiration,
and turn over logs and stones with feverish anxiety in quest of worms and grubs, if haply he can with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
these save himself from empty-handedness."<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> Fly fishing as a recreation justifies all good that has been
written of it, but it is a tell-tale sport that infallibly informs your associates what manner of being you
are. It is self-purifying like the limpid mountain stream its followers love, and no wrong-minded individual
nor set of individuals can ever pollute it. It is too cosmopolitan a pleasure to belong to the
exclusive, and too robust in sentiment to be confined to gossamer gut leaders and midge hooks.</p>

<p>Much, in fact everything, of your success in taking fish in Iron Creek depends on the time of your
visit. For three hundred, thirty days of the year it is profitless water. Then come the days when the
German trout begin their annual <i>auswanderung</i>. No one need be told that these trout do not live in
this creek throughout the year. For trout are brook-wise or river-wise according as they have been
reared, and the habits, attitudes and behavior of the one are as different from the other as are those
of the boys and girls reared in the country from the city-bred. If one of these river-bred fish breaks
from the hook here he does not immediately bore up stream into deep water and disappear beneath a
sheltering log, bank or submerged tree-top as one would having a claim on these waters, but heading
down-stream, he stays not for brake and he stops not for stone till the river is reached. In his headlong
haste to escape he reminds one of a country boy going for a doctor.</p>

<p>It is one of the unexplained phenomena of trout life and habit, why these fish leap as they do here
at this season, when hooked. In no other stream and at no other
time have I known them to exhibit this quality. It is one of those
problems of trout activity for which apparently no reason can be
given further than the one which is said to control the fair sex;</p>

<span class="caption">First View of the Firehole</span>
</div>

<div class='unindent'><br /><br /><br />HE Firehole is a companionable river. Notwithstanding
its forbidding name, it is pre-eminently a stream for
the angler, and always does its best to put him at his ease.
Like some hospitable manorial lord, it comes straight
down the highway for a league to greet the stranger and
to offer him the freedom of its estate. Every fisherman
who goes much alone along streams will unconsciously
associate certain human attributes with the qualities
of the waters he fishes. It may be a quiet charm
that lulls to rest, or a bold current that challenges
his endurance and caution. Between these extremes
there is all that infinite range of moods and
fancies which find their counterpart in the emotions.
The Firehole possesses many of these qualities in a
high degree. It can be broad, sunny and genial, or
whisper with a scarcely audible lisp over languid, trailing
beds of conferva; and anon, lead you with tumultuous voice between rocky walls where a misstep
would be disastrous. The unfortunate person who travels in its company for the time required to
make the tour of the Park and remains indifferent to all phases of its many-sidedness, should turn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
back. Nature will have no communion
with him, nor will he gain her little secrets
and confidences:</div>

<p>During the restful period following
the noon-hour, when there is a truce
between fisherman and fish, we lie in
the shadow of the pines and read "Our
Lady's Tumbler," till, in the drowsy
mind fancy plays an interlude with
fact. The ripple of the distant stream<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
becomes the patter of priestly feet down dim corridors, and the whisper of the pines the rustle of sacerdotal
robes. Through half-shut lids we see the clouds drift across the slopes of a distant mountain,
double as it were, cloud and snow bank vying with each other in whiteness.</p>

<span class="caption">Undine Falls</span>
</div>

<p>Neither the companionship of man nor that of a boisterous stream will accord with our present mood.
So, with rod in hand, we ford the stream above the island and lie down amid the wild flowers in the shadow
of the western hill. For wild flowers, like patriotism, seemingly reach their highest perfection amid
conditions of soil and climate that are apparently most uncongenial. Here almost in reach of hand,
are a variety and profusion of flowers rarely found in the most favored spots; columbines,
gentians, forget-me-nots, asters and larkspurs, are all in bloom at the same
moment, for the summer is short and nature has trained them to thrust forth
their leaves beneath the very heel of winter and to bear bud, flower, and fruit
within the compass of fifty days.</p>

<p>I strongly urge every tourist, angling or otherwise, to carry with him both
a camera and a herbarium. With these he may preserve invaluable records
of his outing; one to remind him of the lavish panorama of beauty of mountain,
lake and waterfall; the other to hold within its leaves the delicately
colored flowers that delight the senses. A great deal is said about the cheap
tourist nowadays, with the emphasis so placed on the word "cheap" as
to create a wrong impression. With the manner of your travel, whether
in Pullman cars, Concord coaches, buck-board wagons, or on foot, this
adjective has nothing to do. It does, however, describe pretty accurately
a quality of mind too often found among visitors to such places&mdash;a mind
that looks only to the present and passing events, and that between
intervals of geyser-chasing, is busied with inconsequential gabble,
with no thought of selecting the abiding, permanent things as
treasures for the storehouse of memory.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>What fisherman is there who has not in his fly-book a dozen or more flies that are perennial reminders
of great piscatorial events? And what angler is there who does not love to go over them at times, one
by one, and recall the incidents surrounding the history of each?</p>

<p>The whole field of angling literature contains nothing more exquisite than the following description
of the last days of Christopher North, as written by his daughter:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was an affecting sight to see him busy, nay, quite absorbed with the fishing tackle scattered
about the bed, propped up with pillows&mdash;his noble head, yet glorious with its flowing locks, carefully
combed by attentive hands, and falling on each side of his unfaded face. How neatly he picked out each
elegantly dressed fly from its little bunch, drawing it out with trembling hand along the white coverlet,
and then replacing it in his pocket-book, he would tell ever and anon of the streams he used to fish in
of old."</p>

<div class='center'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</div>

<span class="caption">Picturesque Rocks in River</span>
</div>

<p>By four o'clock the stream is hidden from the sun and the shadow of the wooded summit at your
back has crossed the roadway and is climbing the heights beyond. As if moved by some signal unheard
by the listener, the trout begin to feed all along the surface
of the water. Leap follows or accompanies leap as
far as the eye can discern up stream, and down stream
to where the water breaks to the downpull of the gorge
below. Select a clear space for your back-cast, wait till a
cloud obscures the sun. * * * * The trout took the
fly from below and with a momentum that carried him
full-length into the air. But there was no turning of the
body in the arc that artists love to picture. He dropped
straight down as he arose and the waters closed over him
with a "plop" which you learn afterward is characteristic
of the rise and strike of the German trout. All this may
not be observed at first, for if he is one of the big fellows,
he will cut out some busy-work for you to prevent his going
under the top of that submerged tree which you had
not noticed before. As it was, you brought him clear by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
a scant hand's breadth, only to have him
dive for another similar one with greater
energy.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;That Delectable Island&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Well, it's the same old story over again,
but one that never becomes altogether tedious
to the angler. And the profitable part
of this tale is that it may be re-enacted here
on any summer afternoon.</p>

<p>Some day a canoe will float down the
river and land on the gravelly beach at the
upper end of that delectable island, just
where the trees are mirrored in the water
so picturesquely. Then a tent will be set up
and two shall possess that island for a
whole, happy week. If you are coming by
that road then, give the "Hallo" of the
fellow craft and you shall have a loaf and
as many fish as you like, and be sent on your way as becomes a man and brother.</p>

<h2><i>TRAILS FROM YANCEY'S AND OTHER TRAILS</i></h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i-47.jpg" width="400" height="271" alt="Yancey&#39;s" title="" />
<span class="caption">Yancey&#39;s</span>
</div>

<div class='unindent'><br /><br /><br />HEN "Uncle" John Yancey, peace to his
ashes, selected the site for his home and
built his cabin under the shelter of the
mountain at the north end of Pleasant
Valley, he displayed that capacity to discover
and appropriate the best things of the
earth which is characteristic of American
pioneers. Here game was abundant and everything
that a remote, mountainous country
could supply to the frontiersman was at
hand. A stream of purest water ran
by the door, and the open, grassy
meadows were ample for the supply
of hay and pasturage. The scenery
is delightful, varied and picturesque. No other locality in the Park is comparable with it as a place of
abode, and there is no pleasanter place in which to spend a week than at "Yancey's."</div>

<p>The government has recently completed a road from the canyon of the Yellowstone, over Mt. Washburn,
down the valley near Yancey's, and reaching Mammoth Hot Springs by way of Lava Creek. This
has added another day to the itinerary of the Park as planned by the transportation companies, and one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
which for scenic interest surpasses any other day of the tour. A mere category of the places of interest
that may be seen in this region would be lengthy.</p>

<p>The lower canyon of the Yellowstone with its overhanging walls five hundred feet high, with pillars
of columnar basalt reaching more than half-way from base to summit, the petrified trees, lofty cliffs,
and romantic waterfalls, will delight and charm the visitor.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 360px;">
<img src="images/i-48.jpg" width="360" height="400" alt="&quot;Swirl and Sweep of the Water&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Swirl and Sweep of the Water&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>The angler will find the waters of this region as abundantly supplied with trout as any area of like
extent anywhere. No amount of fishing will ever exhaust
the "Big Eddy" of the Yellowstone, and it is worth a day's
journey to witness the swirl and sweep of the water after it
emerges from the confining, vertical walls. The velocity of
the current at this point is very great, and surely, during a
flood, attains a speed of sixteen or more miles an hour. In
the eddy itself the trout rise indifferently to the fly, but
will come to the red-legged grasshopper as long as the
supply lasts.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 210px;">
<img src="images/i-49.jpg" width="210" height="300" alt="The Palisades" title="" />
<span class="caption">The Palisades</span>
</div>
<p>Strange to say, they will not take the grasshopper on the
surface of the water. Two bright faced boys who had
climbed down into the canyon watched me whip the pool in
every direction for a quarter of an hour without taking a
single trout. Satisfied that something was wrong, I fastened
a good sized Rangeley sinker to the leader about a foot
above the hook and pitched the grasshopper into the
buffeting currents. An hour later we carried back to
camp twenty-five trout which, placed endwise, head
to tail, measured twenty-five feet on a tape line.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>This use of a sinker under the circumstances was not a great discovery, but it spelled the difference
between success and failure at the time. So I have been glad at most times to learn by experience and
from others the little things that help make a better day's angling.</p>



<p>Once when I knew more about trout fishing than I have ever convinced myself
that I knew since, I visited a famous stream in a wilderness new and
unknown to me, fully resolved to show the natives how to do things.
Near the end of the third day of almost fruitless fishing, the modest
guide volunteered to take me out that evening, if I cared to go. Of
course I cared to go, and I shall never forget that moonlight night
on Beaver Creek. We returned to camp about ten o'clock with
twenty-eight trout, four of which weighed better
than three pounds apiece.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 205px;">
<img src="images/i-50.jpg" width="205" height="293" alt="A Young Corsair of the Plains" title="" />
<span class="caption">A Young Corsair of the Plains</span>
</div>

<p>It may be a severe shock to the sensibilities
of the "super-refined fly-caster" to
suggest so mean a bait as grasshoppers,
yet he may obtain some comfort, as did
one aforetime, by labeling the can in which
the hoppers are carried:</p>

<div class='center'>
"<i>CALOPTENOUS FEMUR-RUBRUM</i>."<br />

<div class='center'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 307px;">
<img src="images/i-51.jpg" width="307" height="388" alt="Tower Falls" title="" />
<span class="caption">Tower Falls</span>
</div>
<p>Then there are Slough Creek, Hell-Roaring
Creek, East Fork, Trout Lake, and a host of
other streams and lakes that have been favorite resorts
with anglers for years, and in which may be taken the very leviathans of six,
seven, eight, and even ten, pounds' weight. He must be difficult to please<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
who finds not a day of days among them. Up to the present time only the red-throat trout inhabit
these waters, but plants of other varieties have been made and will doubtless thrive quite as well as the
native trout.</p>



<p>Owing probably to the fact that, until recently, the region around Tower Creek and Falls was not
accessible by roads, this stream received no attention from the fish commission till the summer of 1903,
when a meager plant of 15,000 brook trout fry was made
there. The scenery in this neighborhood is unsurpassed, and
when the stream becomes well stocked it will, doubtless, be
a favorite resort with anglers who delight in mountain fastnesses
or in the study of geological records of past ages. The
drainage basin of Tower Creek coincides with the limits of the
extinct crater of an ancient volcano. As you stand amid the
dark forests with which the walls of the crater are clothed
and see the evidences on all sides of the Titanic forces once
at work here, fancy has but little effort in picturing something
of the tremendous scenes once enacted on this spot.
Now all is peace and quiet, the quiet of the wilderness, which
save for the rush of the torrential stream, is absolutely noiseless.
No song of bird gladdens the darkened forests, and in
its gloom the wild animals are seldom or never seen. How
strikingly the silence and wonder of the scene proclaim that
nature has formed the world for the happiness of man.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 261px;">
<img src="images/i-52.jpg" width="261" height="332" alt="The Shadow of a Cliff" title="" />
<span class="caption">The Shadow of a Cliff</span>
</div>
<p>Within two hundred yards of the Yellowstone River,
Tower Creek passes over a fall of singular and romantic
beauty. Major Chittenden in his book "The Yellowstone"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
thus describes it: "This waterfall is the most beautiful in the
Park, if one takes into consideration all its surroundings. The
fall itself is very graceful in form. The deep cavernous basin into
which it pours itself is lined with shapely evergreen trees, so
that the fall is partially screened from view. Above it stand those
peculiar forms of rock characteristic of that locality&mdash;detached
pinnacles or towers which give rise to the name. The lapse of
more than thirty years since Lieutenant Doane saw these falls,
has given us nothing descriptive of them that can compare with
the simple words of his report penned upon the first inspiration
of a new discovery: 'Nothing can be more chastely beautiful than
this lovely cascade, hidden away in the dim light of overshadowing
rocks and woods, its very voice hushed to a low murmur
unheard at the distance of a few hundred yards. Thousands
might pass by within half a mile and not dream of its existence;
but once seen, it passes to the list of most pleasant memories.'"</p>



<p>If the angler wanders farther into the wilderness than
any waters named herein would lead him, he will find other
streams to bear him company amid scenes that will live long in
his memory and where the trout are ever ready to pay him the
compliment of a rise. To the eastward flows Shoshone river with its
myriad tributaries, teeming with trout and draining a region far more rugged and lofty than the
Park proper. To the south and west are those wonderfully beautiful lakes that form the source of
the Snake river. Here, early in the season, the great lake or Macinac trout, <i>Salvelinus namaycush</i>, are
occasionally taken with a trolling spoon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>From north to south, from the Absaroka Mountains to the Tetons, on both sides of the continental
divide, this peerless pleasuring-ground is netted with a lace-work of streams. Two score lakes and
more than one hundred, sixty streams are named on the map of this domain which is forever secured
and safeguarded</p>

public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
